<h3>This repo contains the solutions of problems from SoftUni's JS Applications course.</h3>
<i>Please note, the first chapter does not contain any JS code as the lecture is dedicated to basic understanding of HTTP/REST. Some GET, POST etc requests have been uploded here just for consistence, i.e. so that the repo dos not start from chapter 2</i>
